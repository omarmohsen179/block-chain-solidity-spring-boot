# Coffee Supply Chain Blockchain Application

This project demonstrates the use of blockchain technology within a coffee supply chain context. It utilizes Spring Boot for the backend, Web3j for interacting with Ethereum blockchain, and Solidity for smart contracts. The application tracks coffee batch movements through various stages of the supply chain, recording each transaction on the Ethereum blockchain for immutability and transparency.

## Features

- Record and transfer coffee batches through the supply chain.
- View the current owner of any coffee batch.
- Ethereum blockchain integration for secure and transparent record-keeping.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 21
- Ethereum node or Infura API access
- Solidity compiler (solc) for compiling smart contracts
- An Ethereum wallet with some Ether (for deploying contracts and making transactions)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
